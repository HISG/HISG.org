<h2>Community Development</h2>
 
<p>
	CAMBODIA - A project in northwest Cambodia is creating jobs and improving the quality of life by cleaning 
	up the city.  HISG is supporting construction teams that are laying hundreds of meters of pipes that are 
	replacing open ditches full of raw sewage like the one pictured.  The quality of the work has been 
	outstanding, and the response from the community has been equally positive.  It is easy to take something 
	as mundane as a drainage pipe for granted, but the local community is very grateful to no longer have to 
	worry about open sewers.  They spread water-borne diseases and get so full of water during the rainy season 
	that each year children fall into them and drown.  This construction project is making the community safer 
	and cleaner.  You can read more about how this project is impacting the city beyond just economic 
	development online at www.HISG.org.

<h2>Disaster Relief</h2>

<p>
	CHINA - HISG is helping train workers to care for the elderly, as the culture struggles with how to handle 
	the rapidly growing population of senior citizens.  The younger generation is moving away from the 
	traditional practice of personally caring for their parents and grandparents, so for the first time ever 
	in China, large numbers of elderly men and women are in need of care at assisted living homes.  The HISG 
	training is filling two urgent needs by teaching a marketable skill that will help men and women find jobs, 
	 by equipping communities to care for the increasing number of senior citizens who will need assistance.

<h2>HISG Operations</h2>

<p>
	ASIA - HISG staff is currently in Southeast Asia meeting with organizations to discuss some of the 
	challenges specific to that part of the world.  It has been called a "supermarket of disasters," and in 
	the last five years HISG has responded to natural disasters such as a tsunami, a cyclone, earthquakes, and 
	flooding in the region.  There is also political turmoil in the area that hinders economic development.  
	But these challenges have opened up tremendous possibilities and forged strong partnerships that are 
	transforming communities.  This opportunity to revisit what is working and discuss what lies ahead will 
	help HISG continue to connect resources to needs for the people of Southeast Asia.

<h2>Department Focus - Orphan Care</h2> 

<p>
	An important piece of HISG's mission is to provide a well-rounded approach to caring for orphan children.  
	Our desire is to see that as many children as possible have the basic needs of safety, shelter, medical 
	attention, food, and education met.  HISG's Director for Orphan Care has been conducting and compiling 
	research in order to produce an outline of what the ideal orphan care facility might look like.  
	This type of vision will help us and other orphan care agencies understand what needs to be done and how 
	we can work together towards this goal.  The concept paper is currently being constructed, but an excerpt 
	of the education portion is available on our website.  We will post more portions of the paper as they are 
	completed.
