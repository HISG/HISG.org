		Welcome to the Starfish Community Portal. We hope that everyone who visits this website will be able to get a glimpse into the exciting and powerful vision we share in this community. As he Starfish Community, we all have one thing in common. We have a desire to bring hope and a future to the underprivileged of the world. As a network of networks, the Starfish Community shares a commitment with Humanitarian International Services Group in “Connecting Resources to Needs”. 
	</p><br/>
	<p>
		The Starfish Community is a relational network.  There is no paperwork or agreement to sign in order to join the community.  There are no dues or fees.  Since the community is based upon relationships of trust, the way you join the network is to determine that you want to work together with friends and serve the underprivileged of the world – changing lives for the better – both theirs and yours! 
	</p><br/>
	<p>
		The real key to the Starfish Community is relationship. And since the world is full of people already doing amazing things to help others, our belief is that together we can do even more – and do it better.  This website and set of online tools are not the community. Even so, we encourage every visitor to take the time to review the concept documents you will find here. This would include the Holistic Integrated Sustainable Transformation or HIST model and the International Disaster Relief or IDR model. Understanding these models is a great way to quickly gain an appreciation of the way many of the community members operate. Also, take time to read and even add to the vBulletin postings and please take advantage of the online training you’ll find here on how best to connect with others and use these online systems. And while it is not mandatory, we do hope you’ll tell us more about yourself, your interests, your skills and how you might contribute to the community. Simply put, our goal to provide a venue for ordinary people to make an extraordinary difference in the lives of those we serve around the world.  
	</p><br/>
	<p>
		Thank you for visiting. We hope you’ll find a home here among friends, both old and new, joining us as we serve the underprivileged of the world for years to come.
