A Starfish Mass Movement 
Where is HISG going? 


In some ways, HISG can be explained as a connector of networks.   Our relational contact networks encompass nearly every nation of the world and a significant number of the more than 12,000 ethno-linguistic people groups.  As a connector, HISG mobilizes resources across the whole private sector including businesses, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), faith-based and civic groups, and academic institutions.   Our relief and development models provide the framework for identifying and mobilizing 26 different categories of subject matter expert skill sets. Our expanding social networks represent a broad range of private sector skill sets and participants from around the world.  The growing question is, “How do we optimize these networks and connections to make a bigger difference?” 

With this in mind, understanding the interactive dynamics of large social networks will help HISG and our partners to interact more effectively and to accomplish more working together. The purpose of this section is to explore three significant types of social network concepts including:
•	The Rise of Social Networking 
•	The Decentralized Starfish Network  
•	The Nature of Mass Movements 

Following a review of these concepts, we will explore a convergence of their attributes and characteristics from an operational perspective with the intent to leverage aspects of each for greater impact.  By doing so, we hope to catalyze, support, empower, and influence the establishment of a decentralized starfish mass movement. 

This section will be focused on addressing concepts.  Practical application of these concepts relative to specific HISG operations will be addressed in a later section. 

The Rise of Social Networking 

Why do people join a social network?  Eric Hoffer, in “The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements” states that community and equality are the passion of the masses.  For some its about business, for others its about sharing a common cause, but for most, it is simply about belonging and equality. 

Research in a number of academic fields has shown that social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals.
In its simplest form, a social network is a map of all relevant ties between the nodes being studied. The network can also be used to determine the social capital of individual actors. These concepts are often displayed in a social network diagram, where nodes are the points and ties are the lines.

Connecting the Community 
Communities have various levels of belonging.  Lets explore online communities (OLC), since the Internet represents the prime social networking platform.  Most OLCs consist of three social rings -- a densely connected core in the center, loosely connected fragments in the second ring, and an outer ring of disconnected nodes, commonly known as lurkers.  

In this diagram, we see three distinct types of people in our community -- designated by blue, green and red nodes. The proportion of nodes in each ring in this overall population is fairly typical of online communities -- the isolates [lurkers] outnumber the highly-connected. 

The outer orbit in the network above contains the blue nodes. They have been attracted to the OLC, but have not connected yet. This group is the most likely to leave the OLC or remain passive members with little or no contribution to the community. Lurkers in online communities are often more than 60% of the group!

The green nodes have a few connections -- usually with prior acquaintances. They are not connected to the larger community -- no sense of belonging yet. The small clusters of friendships amongst the greens can be maintained by other media and do not need a particular OLC to survive. They are also likely to leave or become passive and will likely do so in unison.

The inner core of the community is composed of red nodes. They are very involved and have formed a connected cluster. The leaders of the OLC are embedded in the core. The core members will stay and build the community. Unfortunately they are in the minority. The core nodes are usually less than 20% of most online groups. Although small, they are a powerful force of attraction. It is the core that is committed and loyal to the OLC and will work on making it a success. They see a win-win for themselves and the group -- better connectivity will help the individual and the group simultaneously.

Sustaining a Social Network 
Online communities and social networks are often conceived and developed by businesses and organizations that focus on: "How can we use the online community to benefit us?" They fail at community development by not creating a strategy that makes sure their target audience is gaining a positive experience and practical benefits from participating in the community. It is amazing how organizations build online social networks but ignore the needs of the very people they are trying to attract and influence. Its no surprise, then, when large chunks of their target group leave when the "next big thing" comes around: SixDegrees → Friendster → Orkut → MySpace → Facebook → Next? To build a vibrant and growing network, you need to support natural human behavior, not work against it.

Connections are key in online social networks -- people are loyal to what they are connected to and what provides them benefits. People stick with established ties they trust. Interacting with those we know and trust brings a sense of warmth and belonging to the virtual communities we visit via our computer screens. Yet, we are open to meeting new people -- as long as we are introduced by those we trust. An established community, with dense interconnectivity, not only keeps existing members happy, but is also a large magnet for contacts of current members -- everyone wants to be connected and included in vibrant communities that provide benefits to members!

Building Connections 
Networks and communities are built on connections.  Better connections usually provide better opportunities.  But, what are better connections, and how do they lead to more effective and productive networks and communities?  How do we build connected networks that create, and take advantage of, opportunities in their region or marketplace?   How does success emerge from the complex interactions within networks? 
 
This section investigates building sustainable communities through improving their connectivity – internally and externally – using network ties to create economic opportunities.  Improved connectivity is created through an interactive process of knowing the network and knitting the network. Knowing the network involves mapping the network.  There are a host of social network tools available to accomplish this objective.  Information can be found at www.orgnet.com from which much of the information in this section was gathered. 

A vibrant community network is generally built or “knit” in four phases, each with its own distinct topology.  Each phase builds a more adaptive and resilient network structure than the prior phase.  Network mapping can be used to track progress through these four stages. 

1) Scattered Fragments - Experience shows that most communities start as small emergent clusters organized around common interests or goals.  Usually these clusters are isolated from each other.  They are very small groups of 1-5 people or organizations that have connected out of necessity.  If these fragments do not organize further, the community structure remains weak and under- 
producing.  Begin weaving the network by asking questions:
•	From whom do you get new ideas that benefit your work?
•	From whom do you access expertise that improves your operations?
•	With whom do you collaborate? 

Network weaving can be accomplished a number of different ways. (7 is Best, 1 is Least) 
7.	Introducing A and B in person and offering a collaboration opportunity to get A and B started in a successful partnership
6.	Introducing A and B in person and contacting A and B afterward to nurture the connection 
5.	Introducing A and B in person
4.	Doing a conference call introduction of A and B 
3.	Doing an email introduction of A and B
2.	Suggesting to A that A should talk with B and then contacting B to let B know to expect a call from A
1.	Suggesting to A that A should talk with B 

2) Single Hub-and-Spoke - Without active leaders who take responsibility for building a network, spontaneous connections between groups emerge very slowly, or not at all.  We call this active leader a network weaver. Instead of allowing these fragments to drift in the hope of making a lucky connection, network weavers actively create new interactions among them

Network weavers begin with a hub and spoke network, with the weaver as the hub.  The weaver has the vision, the energy, and the social skills to connect to diverse individuals and groups and start information flowing to and from them.  The weavers usually have external links outside of the community to bring in information and ideas.  This is a critical phase for community building because everything depends on a weaver who is the hub in the network. However, if multiple weavers are working in the same community, we may get independent multiple hub and spoke networks, with limited overlap between them.

3) Multi-Hub Small-World Network - The transition from network weaver to network facilitator is critical.  The weaver is identifying and mentoring new weavers who will eventually take over much of the network building and maintenance.  If the transition is not made, then, the community network remains dependent on the central weaver and his/her organization.  At the transition point the weaver changes from being a direct leader to an indirect leader, influencing new emergent leaders appearing throughout the community.  This transition is necessary for the network to increase its scale, impact and reach.

Now that other hubs [network weavers] are emerging in the network, the various weavers begin to connect to each other, creating a multi-hub community.  Not only is this network topology less fragile, it is also the best design to minimize the average path length throughout the network – remember, the shorter the hops the better for work flow, information exchange and knowledge sharing!  Information percolates most quickly through a network where the best-connected nodes are all connected to each other.

4) Core/Periphery 
The end goal for vibrant, sustainable community networks is the core/periphery model.  This topology emerges after many years of network weaving by multiple hubs.  It is a stable structure that can link to other well-developed networks in other regions.  The network core in this model contains the key community members, including many who are network weavers, and have developed strong ties amongst themselves. The periphery of this network contains three groups of nodes that are usually tied to the core through looser ties: 
•	Those new to the community and working to get to the core 
•	Bridges to diverse communities elsewhere 
•	Unique resources that operate outside of the community and may span many communities

The periphery allows us to reach ideas and information not currently prevalent in our network. The core allows us to act on those ideas and information. The periphery is the open, porous boundary of the community network. It is where new members/ideas come and go. The periphery monitors the environment, while the core implements what is discovered and deemed useful.

To summarize, starting with a disconnected community, network builders can start weaving together the necessary skills and resources to build simple single-hub networks, followed by a more robust multi-hub network, concluding with a resilient core/periphery structure – maximized for innovation and implementation. 

Bridging Clusters 
Working in isolated clusters is fine if the world around you is not changing. Bridging clusters allows everyone to learn and exchange perspectives and ideas. Connections create cross-fertilization and innovation usually follows

Shape of Networks 
The shape of a social network helps determine a network's usefulness to its individuals. Smaller, tighter networks can be less useful to their members than networks with lots of loose connection (weak ties) to individuals outside the main network. More open networks, with many weak ties and social connections, are more likely to introduce new ideas and opportunities to their members than closed networks with many redundant ties. In other words, a group of friends who only do things with each other already share the same knowledge and opportunities. A group of individuals with connections to other social worlds is likely to have access to a wider range of information. It is better for individual success to have connections to a variety of networks rather than many connections within a single network. Similarly, individuals can exercise influence or act as brokers within their social networks by bridging two networks that are not directly linked (called filling structural holes)

Vibrant and Effective Networks 
What does a vibrant, effective community network look like?  Research has been done to discover the qualities of vibrant networks.   Sociologists, physicists, mathematicians, and management consultants have all discovered similar answers about effective networks.  The amazing discovery is that people in organizations, routers on the Internet, cells in a nervous system, molecules in protein interactions, animals in an ecosystem, and pages on the WWW are all organized in efficient network structures that have similar properties.

Five general patterns are observed in all effective networks: 
1. Birds of a feather flock together: nodes link together because of common attributes, goals 
or governance. 
2. At the same time diversity is important.  Though clusters form around common attributes and goals, vibrant networks maintain connections to diverse nodes and clusters.  A diversity of connections is required to maximize innovation within the network. 
3. Robust networks have several paths between any two nodes.  If several nodes or links are damaged or removed, other pathways exist for uninterrupted information flow among the remaining nodes. 
4. Some nodes are more prominent than others – they are either hubs1, brokers 2, or boundary spanners 3.  They are critical to network health. 
5. Most nodes in the network are connected by an indirect link in the network.  A-B-C-D shows a direct link between A and B, but indirect links between A and C and A and D. Yet, the average path length in the network tends to be short.  There are very few long paths in the network that lead to delay and distortion of information flow and knowledge exchange. 

The Decentralized Starfish Network 

The Starfish and the Spider 
Most of us known that a spider is a creature with eight legs coming out of a central body.  With a magnifying glass, we can see that the spider also has a tiny head and eight eyes.  If you chop off the spider’s head, it dies. It could maybe survive without a leg or two, and probably even stand to lose a couple of eyes, but it certainly couldn’t survive without its head.  The spider has a centralized control system that is similar to most organizations. 

A starfish, at first glance, is similar to a spider in appearance. Like the spider, the starfish appears to have a bunch of legs coming out of a central body.  But that’s where the similarities end. The starfish is decentralized.  With a spider, what you see is pretty much what you get.  A body is a body, a head is a head and a leg is a leg.  But starfish are very different.  The starfish does not have a head.  Its central body is not even in charge.  In fact, the major organs are replicated throughout each and every leg.  If you cut the starfish in half, the animal doesn’t die, it regenerates.  

Starfish have an incredible quality to them: if you cut a leg off, most species will grow a new leg.  And with some varieties, such as the Linckia, or long armed starfish, the animal can replicate itself from a single piece of a leg.  You can cut the Linckia into a bunch of pieces, and each one will regenerate into a whole new starfish.  They can achieve this magical regeneration because in reality, a starfish is a neural network – basically a network of cells.  Instead of having a head like a spider, the starfish functions as a decentralized network.  For the starfish to move a leg, it must convince the other legs that it is a good idea to do so.  The leg starts moving, and then, in a process that no one fully understands, the other legs move and cooperate as well.  There is no brain to make a decision. The starfish doesn’t have a brain, or a central command.  Similar to the starfish, there are a host of emerging organizations that function in a decentralized manner like the starfish.  Examples include such entities as Visa, Skype, Craig’s List, Wikipedia, Alcoholics Anonymous and Apache Software, to name a few. 

Legs of a Starfish Network 
In his book “The Starfish and the Spider” author, Ori Brafman, identifies five legs upon which a decentralized network stands.  As with the starfish, it can lose one or two legs and still survive.  But when you have all five legs working together, a decentralized network can really take off. 

Leg 1 – Circles 
Circles are important to nearly every decentralized network. They provide the vehicle for independent and autonomous operation.  Characteristics of circles include:
•	Once you join, you are an equal.  Its then up to you to contribute to the best of your ability. People commit to what they help create.  
•	Virtual Circles are much larger, but the bonding is lower.  Being in the physical presence of others creates more ownership and bonding, which produces a great level of trust.
•	Circles are not lawless, they depend on norms or values.  Clearly defined and inculcated norms (or values) control behaviors. 
•	When ordinary people are organized into Circles or cells, they gain immense power.  

Leg 2 – The Catalyst  
A Catalyst is any element or compound that initiates a reaction without fusing into that reaction.  In a decentralized organization, a Catalyst is a person who initiates a reaction and gets the organization going and then fades into the background by ceding control to the members.  In letting go of the leadership role, the Catalyst transfers ownership and responsibility to the circle or decentralized organization.  Once the Catalyst moves on, however, their presence is still felt as they provide the inspirational motivation to continue to spur others to action.  Additional characteristics of the Catalyst include:
•	Develops an idea, shares it with others, leads by example  
•	They trust the community and let go of the organization 
•	Often they are not aware of who is doing what in the organization as they are focused outward
•	Casual acquaintances fascinate them, and they are always trying to connect people 
•	They are good at navigating complex social networks 
•	Very comfortable at any level of engagement in influential circles 
•	They never work on commissions – easier to be ethically pure, introductions are more long-term
•	They have fun meeting and helping new people.  They always ask “How can I help this person?”
•	Mobilize people by sharing inspirational stories 
•	They are never pushy but work to try to understand you 
•	Mission oriented, not command and control or objective driven 

Most Catalysts draw upon similar tools to operate and get the job done. Catalysts’ tools include: 
•	Genuine interest in others - No one is boring; everyone is like a walking novel, because they care! 
•	Loose connections – They establish a loose social network with thousands of people. They are able to socially connect people into the network wherever they go. 
•	Mapping – When they meet new people, they immediately begin mapping out how they fit into their vast social network. 
•	Desire to help – wanting to help is the fuel that drives a Catalyst’s ability to connect. 
•	Passion – A Catalyst provides the inspirational drum beat for a decentralized organization because it cannot rely on command and control to motivate participants, it needs a strong and ongoing ideology to keep them going.
•	Meet people where they are – You follow a Catalyst because he understands you. 
•	Emotional Intelligence – Intellectually brilliant, but they tend to lead with emotions.  Emotional connections come first. 
•	Trust – With a decentralized organization, you never know what people are going to do.  You can’t control the outcomes.  All you can control is whether or not people have personal relationships with each other based on trust.  Catalysts build trust throughout the network and the community. 
•	Inspiration – They are passionate about believing in the big dream and it is not about them.  It is not for personal gain.  They have a natural ability to inspire people to action. 
•	Tolerance for ambiguity – They do not know, nor really care who is doing what in the organization. They trust the community.  The more decentralized, the less that is known.  Starfish organizations need ambiguity to survive.  It creates a platform for creativity and innovation. 
•	Hands-off approach – Once a Catalyst gets an organization going, they back off and cede control.  People may get frustrated and say, “What are we supposed to be doing?” This leads people to take charge and have a high level of ownership. 

Leg 3 – Ideology 
Ideology is the glue that holds decentralized networks together.  It is more than a sense of community or the desire to create a better world.  It is a common set of beliefs or values that inspire members to fight and sacrifice of themselves for a common cause.   These common beliefs define the norms or values of the network, which in turn, dictate the cultural DNA.  Since there is no central command and control structure in a decentralized network, a clearly defined ideology is central to controlling behaviors.  The greater the common cause and the stronger the ideology, the longer the network will last. 

Leg 4 – The Pre-Existing Network 
Almost every decentralized network that has made it big was launched from a pre-existing platform.  But gaining entrance into a pre-existing network is not as simple as just showing up with a good idea.  Centralized organizations are not setup to launch decentralized movements.  Without Circles, there is not the infrastructure for people to get involved and take ownership of a new idea.  Circles provide the vehicle to put people together in a close-knit community of empowered members with shared values and a belief that everyone is equal.  Loose knit social networks provide the ideal breeding ground for decentralized circles and typically have a higher tolerance for innovation. Typically it takes the special skills of the Catalyst entering the social network to birth a decentralized movement, but today the Internet also provides an ideal launch pad for new starfish networks, by enabling rapid and simple communication and active participation.  

Leg 5 – The Champion 
The Champion is a restless pioneer in promoting a new idea.  Catalysts are charismatic, but champions take the necessary steps to move the network forward to the next level.  Catalysts inspire and naturally connect people, but there is nothing subtle about the Champion.  Characteristics include:
•	A natural people person and a good salesman 
•	Able to draw people in and make them feel comfortable 
•	People are fascinated by the excitement and charm of the Champion
•	Naturally passionate and lively 
•	Tenacious, will not stop or let go until they have won or they are the best at what they do 
•	Do not do anything half way 
•	Inherently hyperactive and operate well in non-hierarchical environments 
•	Tend to be more like salesman than organizers or connectors; But, as a salesman, they help people get involved in some type of structure or activity 

When a Catalyst joins up with a Champion to architect a movement, create self-empowered circles, tap into an ideology whose time has come, and draw upon a pre-existing network, they can change the course of history. 

A flat, decentralized world 
The Internet has forever changed our world.  The speed and access of global communications has leveled or flattened the competitive playing field to the point that a single individual in the developing world can effectively compete against a large established company in the West. In a flat, decentralized world, there are dis-economies of scale where a single person or small team can financially and operationally disrupt whole industries.  A shy engineer by the name of Craig Newmark never dreamed that the site he launched, to post online listings in the San Francisco Bay Area, would nearly bankrupt the entire newspaper industry.  Few could have believed that a new decentralized telecommunications network called Skype could radically impact the entire telephone industry.  The world is becoming flatter and more decentralized by the day. 

Decentralizing a Centralized Organization 
With the rise of starfish-like decentralized networks, the more common centralized hierarchical organizations are increasingly faced with a formidable challenge; decentralize, learn to effectively interface with decentralized networks, or face possible extinction.  Whole economies, like the newspaper and telephone industries, are on the brink of extinction by emerging decentralized networks like Craig’s List and Skype.   How do you know if your organization is centralized or decentralized?  Review these questions provide by Ori Brafman in “The Starfish and the Spider”. 
1.	Is there a person in charge?
2.	Are there headquarters?
3.	If you thump it on the head, will it die? 
4.	Is there a clear division of roles?
5.	If you take out a unit, is the organization harmed?
6.	Are knowledge and power concentrated or distributed?
7.	Is the organization flexible or rigid?
8.	Can you count the employees or participants?
9.	Are working groups funded by the organization, or are they self-funded? 
10.	Do working groups communicate directly or through intermediaries? 

Ori summarizes the Eight Principles of Decentralization as follows: 
1.	When attacked, a decentralized organization tends to become even more open and decentralized
2.	It is easy to mistake a Starfish for a Spider  
3.	An open system does not have central intelligence; it is spread throughout the system 
4.	Open systems can easily mutate 
5.	The decentralized organization sneaks up on you (because it mutates so quickly) 
6.	As industries become decentralized, overall profits decrease – that is why you want to watch out for them before they take an industry by storm 
7.	Put people into an open system, and they will automatically want to contribute 
8.	When attacked, centralized organizations tend to become even more centralized 

One of the greatest challenges in decentralizing a centralized organization is that of financial sustainability.  As an organization decentralizes, overall profits decrease.  Decentralized organizations must be innovative in developing financial income streams. 

The Nature of Mass Movements			

In a time of accelerating change, social structures around the world are under attack.  Families and communities are being disrupted and undergoing decay.  Natural and man-made disasters, food shortages and global migration all feed into and heighten the problem. The global environment is ripening for the emergence of mass movements.  

The purpose of this section is to understand the causal factors and principles that impact the emergence of a mass movement and how we might be able to catalyze and influence the direction and outcomes of such a movement.  Our hope is that we might catalyze a mass movement that will provide a platform for “Connecting Resources to Needs” for the poor and underprivileged people in developing nations. 
  
Adherents to Mass Movements
It is imperative that we understand the strength and depth of the convictions of adherents to mass movements.  Awareness of their commitment helps us to understand the influence and impact they have within their social structures.  They are a powerful force to be reckoned with.  Most adherents to mass movements come with a similar mindset.  As such, most movements are interchangeable.  One movement can be substituted or birthed from another.  Adherents typically embody the following characteristics:  
•	A readiness to die for the cause
•	Proclivity for united action and self sacrifice 
•	Blind faith, uncompromising, and single hearted allegiance
•	Enthusiasm, and willingness to attempt the impossible 
•	Intense fervor and reckless abandon
•	Willing to sacrifice the present in preparation for the future 
•	Bold and immediate hope for the future 
•	A collective spirit of community and corporate success 
•	Every Mass Movement is in a sense a migration – a movement towards a promised land 

Environmental Factors that Set the Stage for a Mass Movement 
There are a host of environmental factors that help to set the stage for the emergence of a mass movement.  The decentralization of networks and organizations, and the disruption of social structures, have already been discussed. In his book “The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements”, author Eric Hoffer provides a more comprehensive list to include the following. 
•	Boredom, Frustration, Discontentment, Disillusionment with Status Quo 
o	There is no more reliable indicator or a society’s ripeness for a mass movement than the prevalence of unrelieved boredom  
o	Boredom accounts for the almost invariable presence of spinsters and middle-aged women at the birth of mass movements. Hitler made full us of the society’s ladies thirsting for adventure, sick of their empty lives, no longer getting a kick out of love affairs
o	Frustration is greater when we have much and want more, than when we have nothing and want some
o	Its not suffering but a taste of the better things that excite people to riot
o	Adherents must be intensely discontent but not destitute 
o	People are ripe for a mass movement immediately following a great loss of something they hold dear
o	Those who have tasted the better things and then lost them 
o	Alienation by, or disillusionment of, the current authority structure 
•	People wanting to escape from an Unwanted Self 
o	The innermost craving is for a new life, rebirth, or change to acquire new elements of pride, confidence, hope, sense of purpose and worth by identification with a holy cause 
o	The movement offers a substitute either for the whole self or for the elements that make life bearable
•	Disruption of the social glue to include such things as 
o	Discrediting and undermining of authority 
o	Increased divorce and illegitimacy 
o	Others taking over responsibility for feeding, educating and entertaining 
o	Disruption of the family fosters a collective spirit and responsiveness to mass movements 
o	Alienation from or breakdown of the family, social structure, church structure, tribal structure, or sense of community 
•	Lack of Community and Equality 
o	Those who see themselves as spoiled and wasted, crave equality and fraternity more than freedom
o	Equality is the Passion of the Masses
o	People may not be revolting against the powers that be, but because of their weakness 
•	A new mass movement can quickly emerge where one already exists
o	Movements are interchangeable since they draw from the same frustrated mindsets.  One mass movement can transform into another. A religious movement can become a social movement or national revolution or vice versa 
•	The right leadership is necessary.  Though many of the following characteristics provided in “The True Believer” may have negative connotations, they are worth noting.  They will provide us with a heightened awareness towards monitoring the environment for evidence of these indicators.  A mass movement is: 
o	Pioneered by Men of Words (Articulate Speakers) 
•	Undermines established institutions and discredits those in power, prevailing creeds, and institutions 
•	Detaches them from the allegiance of the people 
•	Indirectly creates a hunger for faith 
•	Furnishes the doctrine and slogans of the new faith 
•	Weakens prevailing beliefs and loyalties 
•	Passion is to reform the present 
o	Materialized by Fanatics (Inspirational Leaders) 
•	Chaos is his element 
•	Inspires people to action 
•	Demands blind obedience and total allegiance 
•	Proclaims an immediate hope for the future 
•	Embraces a cause not primarily because of its justness and holiness but because of their passionate attachment that turns everything into a holy cause 
•	Cannot be weaned away from the cause by an appeal to reason or moral sense; They cannot be convinced but only converted 
•	The Fanatical Leader will joyfully sacrifice the present 
o	Consolidated by Men of Action (Operational Managers) 
•	Only the entrance of a Man of Action can save the achievements of the movement 
•	This role is performed by different individuals than the Man of Words or Fanatic 
•	Establishes process and structure to sustain and stabilize the movement 
•	Makes the Doctrine intelligible to win the loyalty of the intellectuals 
•	When the Man of Action emerges, the rapid expansion stage of the mass movement is over and adherents are becoming more interested in stabilizing the movement and achieving personal gain. 

One of the closing statements in Eric Hoffer’s book summarizes the power and impact of emerging mass movements.

“In democracies people are too soft, too pleasure loving and too selfish to die for a nation, a God or a holy cause.  This lack of a readiness to die, we are told, is indicative of an inner rot – a moral and biological decay. The democracies are old, corrupt and decadent.  They are no match for the virile congregations of the faithful who are about to inherit the earth.”

There is much truth to this statement.  But not all mass movements need to be negative.  Accelerations in information, technologies, and the Internet have already created a rapid and positive mass movement, or migration, for billions of people to a new way of communicating and sharing information on a global scale. 

Similarly, these advancements can enable a correlating mass migration in the way ordinary people are able to help one another. As a result, our intent is to facilitate and influence the emergence of a mass movement that enables a global tribe of like-minded practitioners that are bound by a common cause to serve the poor and needy.

Our goal then is to develop, promote, and make available, an established venue so that ordinary people can easily engage to make an extraordinary difference.  We need to proclaim a bold and immediate hope for the future, one that is both doable and achievable.  We need passionate leadership to rally the disillusioned and disenfranchised to this immediate hope, inspire them to action, and consolidate and leverage resources to serve the poor and needy. 

Activities that support the emergence of a Mass Movement 
Many factors ultimately impact the emergence of a mass movement. Leaders cannot create the conditions that make a mass movement successful. There must be intense dissatisfaction with things as they currently exist.  The right leaders often wait many long years in the wings for the environment to ripen and bring forth a movement. Breeding discontent or championing the reasonableness or legitimacy of a new way cannot initiate a mass movement.  When the environment is ripe, the following list provides the types of activities that will help influence the launch and direction of a mass movement: 
•	Create an audacious Hope for the Future 
o	Those who have Hope for the Future proceed recklessly with the present, wreck it if necessary and create a whole new world. 
o	People can live without hope if they are kept incessantly busy.  This is the case for many 40-50 year old people that have acquired their fortune and now look for purpose in life.  A mass movement provides a substitute for individual hope.
o	The unemployed are more likely to follow peddlers of Hope than those that provide relief 
o	What have people lost that we can help give them back?
o	What is the “immediate hope” they can reach for and believe in? 
•	Define a common enemy
o	Solidify the people towards a common goal by picking a worthy enemy – nothing unites the troops like a common enemy. 
o	When we have a common enemy, we look for allies. 
•	Create a Link to the Glorious Past
o	There is no more potent dwarfing of the present than by viewing it as a mere link between a glorious past and a glorious future.  
o	Historical awareness imparts a sense of continuity and legitimizes the new movement. 
•	Define the source of irresistible power 
o	The ones who rush into undertakings of vast change usually feel they are in possession of some irresistible power. 
o	Adherents of a mass movement feel that they are in possession of some potent doctrine, infallible leader, or new technique which is the source of irresistible power. 
•	Help people escape from self 
o	Many people want to hide in the masses.  They substitute corporate success for individual success.  They allow others to make and have the responsibility for their decisions.
o	Innermost craving is for a new life, rebirth, or change to acquire new elements of pride, confidence, hope, sense of purpose and worth by identification with a holy cause 
o	Offers substitutes either for the whole self or for the elements that make life bearable
o	Offers a substitute for individual hope or a way to forget self life 
•	Create community and equality 
o	In order to succeed, form a compact community at the earliest possible moment.
o	Those who see themselves as spoiled and wasted, crave equality and fraternity more than freedom.  Equality is the Passion of the Masses.
o	Any aid or support must be provided to the whole community or family versus individual help or success.  Individual success undermines the family/community stability. For those in community, self-reliance amounts to individual isolation. 
o	Develop the capacity to rapidly absorb and thoroughly integrate all newcomers. 
o	There needs to be a quick and total absorption of the frustrated. The one who comes with the most perfected collective framework wins. 
•	Create unity of action and self-sacrifice
o	To school an individual for unity of action is to ready him for acts of self-denial.
o	To ripen a person for self-denial, he must be stripped of his individual identify and distinctiveness.  The best way to accomplish this is by complete assimilation into a collective body. 
•	Every act, no matter how trivial, the individual must associate himself with the group, congregation, or community. 
•	Joys, sorrows, pride and confidence must spring from the group. 
•	He must never feel alone; to be cast out would be worse than death.
•	Uniforms, flags, emblems, parades, music, logos and elaborate etiquette and ritual are designed to separate the individual from his self-identity. 
o	The human plasticity necessary for the realization of drastic and abrupt change seems to be a by-product of the process of unification and inculcation of a readiness for self-sacrifice. 
o	People in a hurry will imitate more readily than people at leisure.  Hustling, thus, tends to produce uniformity. In the deliberate fusing of individuals into a compact group, incessant action will play a considerable role. Mass movements use action as a means of unification.  
o	Men of thought seldom work well together.  Men of action usually find camaraderie.
•	Define the Doctrine 
o	In order to be effective, it need not be understood, but believed in. 
o	If a doctrine is unintelligible, it has to be vague, if it is not vague, it needs to be unverifiable.  Believe with your hearts, not your minds.
o	When a movement rationalizes its doctrine and makes it intelligible, it is a sign that its dynamic span is over. The movement is stabilized by the intellectuals and, hence, the need to make the doctrine intelligible. 
o	The true doctrine is a master key to all the world’s problems and the Hope for the future. 
o	Propaganda cannot force its way into the unwilling mind.  It penetrates minds already open and rather than instill opinion it articulates and justifies opinions already present in the mind of the recipient and echoes their innermost feelings. 
o	Propaganda succeeds mainly with the frustrated. 
o	Nationalism and tribalism are the most durable sources of mass enthusiasm.
•	Substitute for an existing movement 
o	All mass movements are interchangeable, since they come from the same mindset 
•	Identify and connect the leaders
o	Leaders personify the certitude, creed, and the defiance and grandeur of power. They articulate and justify the resentment dammed up in the souls of the frustrated.  They kindle the vision of a breath-taking future, so as to justify the sacrifice of a transitory present. They stage the world of make-believe so indispensable for the realization of self-sacrifice and united action. They evoke the enthusiasm of communion – the sense of liberation from a petty and meaningless individual existence.  Chaos is their element.  
o	A movement is pioneered by men of words, materialized by fanatics, and consolidated by men of action.

Operational support to a mass movement
A mass movement typically emerges as a spontaneous reaction of the masses to some type of precipitating event(s) that is pioneered by Men of Words into a common cause, and materialized by Inspirational Leaders into a mass movement.  There are certain types of operations that organizations can provide to support the emerging movement such as:
•	Provide a venue and platform for the right kind of leaders to promote the Doctrine, Dogma and Rituals 
o	Men of Words, Inspirational Leaders, Men of Action 
•	Infuse people with pride, and hope for he future 
o	Give them jobs, purpose and meaning in life
o	Community success is more important than individual success 
•	Develop a Vehicle to capture, inculcate and assimilate all Comers to the Movement 
o	The one who comes with the most perfected collective framework wins 
o	Chief preoccupation is to foster, perfect and perpetuate a vehicle or venue for unity of action and self-sacrifice 

Mass movements can emerge rapidly and elicit large-scale drastic changes.  We would do well to understand their nature and causal factors.  In doing so, our hope is to influence their direction and outcomes. 

When hopes and dreams are loose in the streets, it is well for the timid to lock the doors, shutter the windows, and lie low until the wrath has passed for there is often a monstrous incongruity between the hopes, however noble and tender, and the actions which follow them.

Operational Concepts Related to a Starfish Mass Movement 

The purpose of this section is to combine and leverage the characteristics and attributes of the three types of social network concepts reviewed including:
•	The Rise of Social Networking 
•	Decentralized Starfish Networks 
•	The Nature of Mass Movements 

By doing so, we hope to understand the operational requirements to catalyze, support, empower, and influence the establishment of a decentralized starfish mass movement.  The following thoughts and concepts are provided in the context of an operational nature to identify potential areas of support and focus for the starfish network to catalyze a movement.  This section will be focused on addressing the following operational concepts: (Specific issues related to HISG operations will be addressed in detail in a later section.) 
•	Culture and Ideology 
•	A Common Cause 
•	Structure 
•	Leadership and Management  
•	Knowledge, Information, and Communications  
•	Finances and Resources 
•	Training 
•	Operations
•	Performance 
•	Change Management 

Culture and Ideology 
In a decentralized starfish network or mass movement, there is no one in control.  There is no operational chain of command or central headquarters.  Even when building a social network, the network weaver is focused on raising up new leaders to take over the leadership role.  As a result, an ideology is the primary means of controlling how the adherents behave.  

A group’s ideology is composed of a set of shared values or common beliefs.  These values or common beliefs define the cultural DNA of the group.  People of a common cultural DNA will typically gravitate to one another.  Sometimes we talk about being of the same “tribe”.  The stronger the ideology, the more influence it has over actions, even to the point of people being willing to give up their life for the cause.   Additional thoughts on a core ideology include: 
•	Most organizations identify 3 to 5 core values or common beliefs that define their ideology. 
•	Behavior statements should be developed that reflect actions indicative of the core values.
•	It takes 27-45 days of continuous conscious thought and action to change behaviors associated with  new values or ideology. 
•	A shared ideology or set of values produces strong ownership and commitment.  
•	Tribal relationships override any program, process, procedure, or business objective. 
•	People commit to what they help create. 
•	In an open system, people lead by example and take action. 
•	What is the process to inculcate the DNA across the organization? 
•	How do we engage the Catalyst to inculcate the DNA and inspire people to act? 

In additional to ideology, the culture of the starfish network must promote community and camaraderie.  Though a common cause will focus actions, and some will join a network for financial gain, most adherents to networks and mass movement join because they are looking for a culture of community that meets their personal need for equality and belonging.

A Common Cause 
A common cause is a powerful tool for unified action within a starfish network or mass movement.  Different adherents may engage for different reasons but they all have a common cause or outcome they are working together and joining forces to achieve.  As the old saying goes, “nothing unites the troops like a common enemy”.  The common cause or defined outcome must be specific enough to cause defined action but broad enough to cover a wide range of potential skill sets of the adherents that join the network or movement. 

Structure
The structure of the starfish network should be decentralized with independent and autonomous Circles or cells being empowered by leaders and catalysts.  With a lack of hierarchy, all members of the network are considered equal and work together for a common cause. In a completely decentralized starfish network or mass movement, the following characteristics may exist:
•	There may be no central headquarters or common location for command and control.  
•	There may be no clear division of work or departments.  Anyone can do anything. 
•	No central policing authority.  Everyone is responsible for themselves and everyone else. 

Hybrid organizations may support and empower the network or movement to achieve their designated outcomes or common cause by providing value added services.  In the case of HISG, establishing a venue or platform to centralize and share information may be of significant value  

Leadership and Management 
In all three social network concepts explored, a small loose connection of people can have a large amount of influence and power.  In all cases, and particularly when no one is in charge, the amount of power and influence leaders exercise is determined by the strength and trust of the relational connections. 

In all cases, leaders are necessary to inspire and lead the people into united action.  Management and decision-making needs to be decentralized to the front lines of operation where knowledge, creativity, innovation and ownership are greatest.  

Each of the social network concepts we have explored requires different types of leadership summarized by the following. 
•	The Primary roles in the social network include: 
o	Network Weaver 
o	Network Facilitator
•	The primary roles in the decentralized starfish network include:
o	Catalysts
o	Champions 
•	The primary roles in a mass movement include: 
o	Pioneered by Men of Words (Articulate Speakers) 
o	Materialized by Fanatics (Inspirational Leaders) 
o	Consolidated by Men of Action (Operational Managers) 

If we converge the requirements of all three concepts, we end up with primarily two types of leadership.  It takes both working together to catalyze, inspire, empower, and establish the network. 
•	Inspirational Leaders 
•	Operational Manager 

Knowledge, Information, and Communications  
In a starfish network or mass movement, knowledge is greatest on the front line, at the edge of the network.  When it comes to social networking, innovation and creativity lie at the intersection point of different social clusters.  The operational focus should be for information to be shared and decentralized throughout the network.  

Communications across the network should occur directly between members versus through intermediaries or through an established chain of command.  The operational focus should be to establish a communications platform to enable and enhance interaction between individual members across the network. 

Finances and Resources 
As organizations or industries decentralize, profits decrease. In a pure starfish network or mass movement, there are no paid positions or titles because they create turf wars and focus on interests of personal gain and betterment.  When people in a mass movement begin to focus on personal interests, the dynamic growth stage of the movement has ended and people are now looking to stabilize and establish the movement.   

Individual units (Circles, cells) should be largely self-funded with unit leaders primarily responsible for acquiring and managing their own funds.  The overall power or influence of the network or movement is proportional to the strength of the relational connections and the number of members or adherents.  The ideal situation is that it costs nothing to add a member and each new member makes the network more valuable.  With every new member, there are more resources within the network. 

Training
Training must be a core component of any social network.  Transfer of cultural DNA, sharing of information, and utilizing an established process or platform all requires some type of training.   In addition, capturing lessons learned and sharing best practices optimizes performance. 

Operations
In a decentralized starfish network, small Circles of 6-12 people are the key to action, creativity and ownership.  As ordinary people become equal members, the Circle is empowered and gains greater influence and capability.  Circles should be able to operate independently with autonomy.  Leveraging the power of the Circles across a network or mass movement is enabled through information sharing and communications.  Information sharing provides for a common picture, allowing adherents to self-synchronize their efforts without any chain of command. 

Equality is the passion of the masses.  Circles provide the ideal social setting to establish a strong sense of community and equality necessary for adherents.  The operational imperative is for all newcomers to find an immediate place to plug in.  Everyone should be able to participate and find equality and community.  Assimilation is ensured through a sense of belonging and a defined ideology that controls behavior within the community. 

Small Circles should be used to address issues and resolve challenges that the network or movement might face.  For problem-solving or innovation, Circles should be provided with resources and released to address the issue as they see fit.  People commit to what they help create.  Performance metrics to monitor, measure, and manage the health and strength of the network should be through the vitality of the small Circles. 

In a social network, strength of the network and performance are measured through such metrics as centrality (degree, betweenness, closeness), network centralization, network reach, boundary spanners, and peripheral players. 

A centralized organization can decentralize the user experience through practices like User Ratings, a safety factor like that used in PayPal, and ongoing opportunities for public comments that have impact to their reputation. 

Performance
Performance in a decentralized network or movement is best measured by the successful of the social vehicle used to carry out the actions of the network.  For a starfish network or mass movement, success might be measured by the strength and vitality of the Circles or communal structure established, for a social network it may be the strength and centrality of the connection.  If the focus of a group of circles is community transformation, then performance metrics must be chosen that are relative to the success of the community.  

Change Management 
In a world of accelerating change, organizational flexibility and adaptation have become survival skills.  But they are the natural order for decentralized starfish networks and mass movements.  They are both marked by their ability for rapid and drastic adaptation and transformation. This is enabled by spontaneous intra-network information sharing and empowered Circles that can operate independently. 
Decentralization involves chaos, but also provides a platform for creativity and innovation, essential for growth and adaptation. 

When under attack or threat from the environment, Starfish Networks become more decentralized while centralized organizations become more centralized and consolidated.  Starfish organizations naturally adapt to change while centralized organizations resist change.  The typical evolution of an industry or environment is from decentralized chaos, to centralized organization, and then back to decentralization by distributive networks.  The final stage is decentralized but instead of chaos, you have a distributive network that can function independently and with autonomy.
