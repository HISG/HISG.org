		"They were in school when the rebels came with guns and began shooting. They ran. They ran for their lives. They ran for their futures. They ran in fear and dread. They ran with holes in their shoes and ragged clothes a year ago and still wear them to work today. They ran to this place, Feina, and then they stopped running. They are exploited. They earn an average of less than $1.00 a day working in the market. They ran from their education and from their families to survive the bullets that flew through the air. They ran to this future... one of no education, no money, exploitation, no family, and themselves as friends. They ran for a future and received the present... sleeping huddled together on the dirt ground with no blankets to cover them in the cold season. Is hope on the horizon? Will a new faith be planted and will rays of kindness and generosity sprout a future back into their lives?"

	<p>The quote above describes the plight of the "street boys" of Feina, Darfur. The street boys are children under age 17 who fled to Feina once the fighting broke out. All of them are homeless. Some are orphans. Some have no idea if the rest of their family survived, and if they survived, to which camp they fled. They are bright young men, some of the hardest workers in Feina, but their situation is dire. HISG is proposing a home for these boys, where their most basic needs of food, clothing, safety and shelter will finally be met.</p><br/>

	<p>HISG is working with another organization to implement this project, because these boys have nowhere else to go. A UNICEF worker put it this way: "the impact of violence, disease, malnutrition and dependency is leaving a mark on this generation of children, weakening their capacity and trapping them in the cycle of poverty." HISG, in its mission to care for the least cared-for portions of society, wants to help these children break out of this "cycle of poverty" and reach their potential. This is an incredible opportunity to impact an entire generation and an entire culture. Constructing and operating the home for one year will cost US$ 84,000, but will dramatically change the lives of these children. Please consider a <a href="{% url donation %}">donation to HISG</a> for this project.</p><br/>
