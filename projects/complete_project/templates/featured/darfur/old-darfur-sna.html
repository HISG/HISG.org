	</div>
	<p>
		HISG's mission is to help communities become more self-sufficient and less reliant on 
		outside aid, but HISG also recognizes individual needs and we try to meet those needs 
		when it is possible to do so. A family in Nyala has approached HISG staff requesting a 
		hearing aid for their daughter. This girl is 17 years old, has graduated high school and 
		has earned an academic scholarship to a university, but suffers from deteriorating hearing 
		loss. The university will not let her enroll until she gets a hearing aid. This family is 
		very poor, and with three other children, cannot afford this device. HISG is trying to raise 
		$2,000 to buy a hearing aid for the girl so that she can pursue her dream of higher education. 
		If you would like to help this family, please <a href="{% url donation %}">click here</a> 
		to donate.
